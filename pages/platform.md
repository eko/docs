# Overview

**M3O** is a soon to be released serverless platform for microservices development in the cloud and beyond. It will remove the 
hassle of managing infrastructure and the complexity of cloud-native by providing a fully managed platform for Micro services.

## Features

The **M3O** platform will include the following features:

- **Global service deployment** - Services will run globally by default in a multi-cloud environment

- **Auto configuration** - Services will be auto configured with the required registry, message broker, etc

- **Simplified debugging** - Stats, logs and tracing will be available in an easy and clean way for every service

- **Connect from anywhere** - Ability to connect and extend the network beyond the platform. Run services locally or in your own cloud.

## Getting Started

Join the #platform channel on [slack](https://micro.mu/slack) to discuss more. We'll be revealing the details soon for an invite-only beta.
